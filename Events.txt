When at an event:
  Make as few code changes a possible! New code almost never works first try...
  Only use one laptop! FRC events never have public wifi so you can't count on using git.
  Write a preflight checklist and *actually go through it* before each match. test every subsystem throughly. catching a problem early often decides the result of a match.
  Record auto in all matches. If you have to tweak something it's better to see what actually happened instead of relying on memory.
