When at an event:

In the pits:
  Keep a programmer on pit crew to fix the robot code and talk to judges.
  Make as few code changes a possible! New code almost never works first try... (a good rule here is to only *tune* code instead of writing new code, that way you have a much smaller chance to break something)
  Only use one laptop! FRC events never have public wifi so you can't count on using git.
  Write a preflight checklist and *actually go through it* before each match. test every subsystem throughly. catching a problem early often decides the result of a match.
  You can help you alliance partners! Ask if any partners need code help before playoffs begins (this is especially true in week 1 events, where teams have had less time to write code)

In a match:
  MAKE SURE YOU SELECT AN AUTO.
  Record auto in all matches. If you have to tweak something it's better to see what actually happened instead of relying on memory.
